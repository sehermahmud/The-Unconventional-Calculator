For opening the javascript "The Unconventional Calculator" project, follow this step below:

1. Go to the place where you have the project.
For example: "user/user/desktop/The Unconventional Calculator".

2. Go inside of the Folder.
Then you will find a "index.html" file in there.

3. Double click the "index.html" file
It will automatically open the "The Unconventional Calculator" website in your browser

now you have done it. soooo the next step is tooooo Enjoy!


Do whatever with the project! 
Explore the coding inside it! 
Also inpect this website!
Add any Additional features as you like!

And you don't need my advice that what you should do!

But!!!

If you want to debug the code for your mistake that you make after Adding any Additional features, I will suggest to use this Extension called "Debugger for Chrome".

If you have it, use it for debugging but if you don't! 

please follow the steps below to install and make the Extension(Debugger for Chrome) work: 

1. go to the market place in the side navigation or press shift+command+x and it will show your the market place

2. In the search box provide in the vscode, copy this "Debugger for Chrome"
The exact one looks like chrome logo or icon or whatever you call that, that dosen't matters

3. now click the install button beside the chrome icon ( and saying this that, logo or icon or whatever you call that, that dosen't matters)

4. after that if your have the vscode folder, you can find the "launch.json" inside that vscode folder and inside it change this code in the 11th line, and the code is writed

"url": "file:///Users/sehermahmud/npm-global/The-Unconventional-Calculator/index.html" 

but change the given url into your url, in the browser copy this project url and replace my  with your url and save the file


But if you don't have the vscode folder! so go to the main bar and click the debug or run 
option(it's any one of them, mine is the run option cause i don't have the debug option but 
you have, it's fine, it is the same). now click the Start Debugging and in will show your a 
list palettle and then choose the first one that say the word chrome in it! after doing that 
it will disappear and then again go to the main bar and click the debug or run option now click 
the Start Debugging and the debug will start! and it will show your take you to a another window 
in there your project will be displayed and the window will be only for debugging.

In the vscode, it almost same as in the inpecter, in the source

very good! for the long step or rather i will called it a long journey and you may start your 
debugging

for more details or if it doesn't work please go to there webpage in the given link

1. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome

In github page

2. https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug

Optional: if you want to see if your debugging works to this changes in your code

1. go to the assets/scripts/app.js  file

2. In there, change the 7th line by pasting this code 

return usrInput.value;

3. now in the 33 line, give a breakpoint and then save it.

after that start debugging and it will show your project automatically in a another window.

4. and then type "5" in the box and press the "+" sign and go to vscode(your editer) and see 
in the left side of the vscode window there will be outputs and that means it works but if it's
blank that means it not working. so the solution for that, you try again to make it work but 
still if not see the web page docs, there is a link in here.


I have last word to say that !!!!Feel free to do whatever you like! Enjoy!!!!
